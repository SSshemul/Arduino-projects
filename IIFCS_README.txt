      Intelligent Irrigation & Fertilizer Control System (IIFCS) is a device to operate automatic irrigation systems using Micro-controller and drip irrigation systems. Appropriate environmental conditions are necessary for optimum plant growth,improved crop yields, and efficient use of water and other resources. Automating the irrigation process by the soil condition allows more plant growth with less labor requirement. 
      In the field of agriculture, use of proper method of irrigation is important because the main reason is the lack of rains & scarcity of land reservoir water. The continuous extraction of water from earth is reducing the water level due to which lot of land is coming slowly in the zones of un-irrigated land. Another very important reason of this is due to unplanned use of water due to which a significant amount of water goes waste. For this purpose; I use this automatic plant irrigation system.
      In the conventional irrigation system, the farmer has to keep watch on irrigation timetable, which is different for different crops. The project makes the irrigation automated. With the use of low cost sensors and the simple circuitry makes this project a low cost product, which can be bought even by a poor farmer .This project is best suited for places where water is scares and has to be used in limited quantity. The Project presented here waters your plants regularly(Drip Irrigation Method) when you are out for vocation. The heart of the project is the ATmega32 micro-controller. This is safest and no manpower is required. Require smaller water sources, for example, less than half of the water needed for a Drip Irrigation system. This is very useful to all climatic conditions any it is economic friendly. 
      The micro-controller will be programmed for the full harvest of crops lasting for about 3 to 6 months. A RTC (DS1307) will be responsible for the date and time measurement for micro-controller. As per instructed by a Agriculture Officer we set our program for a month long for a certain crop. Then the IIFCS will irrigate on the prior day if the humidity level is less than threshold value. It will also supply liquid fertilizer using the irrigation pipe as per instructed by Agriculture Experts. A solar panel will charge up a battery for day long and irrigate for 2-3 times a day if needed. 
Agriculture is life blood of economy of our country. This projects helps the farmer to overcome the drawbacks of traditional irrigation system. From this project we provide the new technology for farmer to improve the quality of their irrigation system. This project helps those farmers which do not have sufficient water for their farming.
